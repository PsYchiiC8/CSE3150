There is a Makefile attached, simply use the command "make" to compile, and "./program {+ the txt file}" to run
Alternatively-
g++ ConsoleTest.cpp ECAirlineFinancial.cpp ECAirlineOperation.cpp ECAirlineSimulator.cpp ECAirlineTicketing.cpp ECAirport.cpp ECConsoleUIButton.cpp ECConsoleUIListBox.cpp ECConsoleUITextField.cpp ECConsoleUITextLabel.cpp ECConsoleUIView.cpp ECFlight.cpp ECFlightItinerary.cpp ECTextViewImp.cpp ECConsoleUISearchButton.cpp -std=c++11
and then
./program (+ .txt file)

SearchForFlights Button should work fine, it should have all necessary functionality with correct outputs
The visuals are a little off. The top bar and the first few lines gets put multiple times and for some reason, it is put up pretty high
